# 🥳 ChatSparty

**Multi-agent chats, zero-latency experiments, infinite ideas.**

---

Welcome to **ChatSparty**, your playground for exploring *multi-agent AI conversations*.

We’re building a space where multiple LLM-powered agents can chat, debate, plan, and build ideas together in real time. Whether you’re testing workflows, simulating team decision-making, or just watching your agents argue about who should make coffee, ChatSparty helps you explore what’s possible with local, private, fast multi-agent experimentation.

## 🚀 What We’re About

- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Create and run multiple AI personas with unique roles and goals.
- **Local-First:** Use Ollama and local LLMs for *privacy* and *speed*.
- **Workflow Testing:** Simulate and refine agent workflows with persistent memory layers like [Mem0](https://mem0.ai).
- **Open Source:** Hackable, extendable, and community-friendly.

## ✨ Why We Exist

We believe multi-agent systems are the future of AI. Teams of small, specialized AIs working together can create more dynamic, trustworthy, and effective systems than single, monolithic models.

ChatSparty exists to:
✅ Test agent-to-agent communication patterns.  
✅ Explore emergent behaviors in teamwork and planning.  
✅ Let developers prototype multi-agent workflows quickly.

## 🌱 Get Involved

Interested in exploring multi-agent workflows, building new personas, or integrating with tools like Mem0 for persistent memory? We’d love to collaborate.
